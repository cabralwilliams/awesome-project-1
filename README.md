# Discover History

## User Story
- AS A History Buff
- I WANT to know what notable events occurred on a given day AND
- I WANT to be able to be provided with media titles (movies/television series/books) that provide more information on a given topic AND
- I WANT to be able to revisit previous topics searched without having to know their specific dates

## Application Functionality
The application will show on initial load a featured event for that day and then also a clickable list of other events that took place.  Lower down on the page will be a list of saved events that the user had searched for in the past.  A button will allow the user to select a day other than the current day to search.

Built With HTML, CSS, Foundation, Java Script, Moment.js and Jquery.

We use the https://history.muffinlabs.com/date/ API to retrieve history events  for specific day, https://www.googleapis.com/books API to search for books related to a specific event,  and http://www.omdbapi.com to look for books related to the user search as well.

We also use localStorage to store user manual searches.
